# Async::Safe

Runtime thread safety monitoring for concurrent Ruby code.

This gem provides a TracePoint-based ownership tracking system that detects when objects are accessed from multiple fibers or threads without proper synchronization. It helps catch concurrency bugs during development and testing with zero overhead in production.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/async-safe/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/async-safe/actions?workflow=Test)

## Motivation

Ruby's fiber-based concurrency (via `async`) can lead to data races when objects are accessed concurrently. This gem helps you catch these concurrency bugs in your test suite by detecting when multiple fibers access the same object simultaneously.

Enable it in your tests to get immediate feedback when invalid concurrent access occurs.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/async-safe/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/async-safe/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use `async-safe` to detect thread safety violations in your Ruby code.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/async-safe/releases/index) for all releases.

### v0.5.0

  - More conservative tracking of objects using call/return for ownership transfer.
  - Introduced guard concept for splitting ownership within a single object, e.g. independently concurrent readable and writable parts of an object.

### v0.4.0

  - Improved `Async::Safe.transfer` to recursively transfer ownership of tracked instance variables.

### v0.3.2

  - Better error message.

### v0.3.0

  - Inverted default model: classes are async-safe by default, use `ASYNC_SAFE = false` to enable tracking.
  - Added flexible `ASYNC_SAFE` constant support: boolean, hash, or array configurations.
  - Added `Class#async_safe!` method for marking classes.
  - Added `Class#async_safe?(method)` method for querying safety.
  - Added `Class.async_safe_traverse` for custom deep transfer traversal (opt-in).
  - Improved `Async::Safe.transfer` to use shallow transfer by default with opt-in deep traversal.
  - Mark built-in collections (`Array`, `Hash`, `Set`) as single-owner with deep traversal support.
  - Removed logger feature: always raises `ViolationError` exceptions.
  - Removed `Async::Safe::Concurrent` module: use `async_safe!` instead.

### v0.2.0

  - `Thread::Queue` transfers ownership of objects popped from it.
  - Add support for `logger:` option in `Async::Safe.enable!` which logs violations instead of raising errors.

### v0.1.0

  - Implement TracePoint-based ownership tracking.
  - Add `Async::Safe::Concurrent` module for marking thread-safe classes.
  - Add `thread_safe` class method for marking thread-safe methods.
  - Add `Async::Safe.transfer` for explicit ownership transfer
  - Add violation detection and reporting
  - Zero overhead when monitoring is disabled
